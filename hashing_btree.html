                <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    At its core, <strong>Systems Design</strong> is the art and science of architecting the components of a large-scale application. The primary challenge arises from <strong>scale</strong>. A simple application that works perfectly for a hundred users will crash and burn under the load of a million users. System design is about planning for that success.

                    Imagine you build a social media site. Initially, you run it on a single computer (a server). This server does everything: it runs the application logic, communicates with users, and stores all the data (profiles, posts, photos) on its hard drive.

                    This works fine for a small number of users. But as you become popular, thousands of requests hit your server every second. It gets overwhelmed, slows down, and eventually crashes. The first step is to add more application servers to handle the incoming traffic. But this introduces a new, critical problem: <strong>Where does the data live?</strong>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">
                    If User A's data is on Server 1, and their request gets routed to Server 2, Server 2 has no way to access that data. This is the fundamental motivation for separating the application from the data.

                    Now, no matter which App Server a user's request hits, it can get the correct data from the central database. This architecture is scalable and consistent.

                    Without any optimizations, the only way for a database to find a row is to look at every single row, one by one, from top to bottom. This is a <strong>Full Table Scan</strong>, an operation with $O(n)$ time complexity.

Instead of reading the whole book to find a topic, you look it up in the index and are given the exact page numbers. There are different ways to build this index, each with its own trade-offs.

                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Replication solves reliability, but every replica still has to hold a full copy of the entire dataset. What if your data is too big for a single machine? The answer is <strong>Sharding</strong>.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Sharding is the process of horizontally splitting a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called **shards**. Each shard is its own independent database, holding a subset of the total data.</p>

                        <li><strong class="text-green-400">Horizontal Scaling:</strong> It allows you to scale your database across many machines, providing almost limitless storage and write capacity.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-cyan-400">Shard Key:</strong> You need a rule to decide which shard gets which piece of data. This rule is based on a "shard key". A common strategy is to shard by `user_id`.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-red-400">Increased Complexity:</strong> Sharding adds significant complexity. Queries that need to access data across multiple shards (e.g., joining data from User A and User Z) become difficult and slow. You must design your system to avoid cross-shard joins.</li>
